While searching and pondering about what problem could be interesting, I had the idea of playing around with the names of the characters and the relation to the race of said character.\r\n\r\nIn this report, I will discuss and show an approach used to predict the races of the characters from Lord of the Rings using a naive Bayes classifier and various techniques for natural language processing. The dataset used consists of 827 observations (characters) and their respective race.\r\n\r\n### Data fields\r\n- name: the name of the character\r\n- race: the race of the character. There are five possible races: Man, Ainur, Elf, Dwarf and Hobbit.\r\n\r\n### Tools used\r\n- Spark (Pyspark)\r\n- R: for scraping, transforming and preparing the data.\r\n\r\n## Scraping the data\r\nThe data used for the study was scraped from the website http://lotrproject.com/ (which is awesome). At the moment of writing, the homepage of the site features a family tree of all the characters from Tolkien's universe. Using Chrome's *View Page Source*, I copied the HTML code that is related to the characters to a new file.\r\n\r\nThen using R and the [rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf) web scraping library, I was able to scrap the wanted data. The next piece of show shows this.\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(rvest)\r\nhtml_data <- read_html(\"~/Development/lotr-names-classification/lotr-names-html.html\")\r\ncharacters_data <- data.frame(name = character(0), race = character(0),\r\n                              stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\r\n\r\nfor (i in 1:952){\r\n  \r\n  # Get the name\r\n  name <- html_data %>%\r\n    html_nodes(paste0('#', i)) %>%\r\n    html_text()\r\n  \r\n  race_and_class <- strsplit(html_data %>%\r\n    html_nodes(paste0('#', i)) %>%\r\n    html_attr('class'), split = ' ')\r\n  \r\n  if (length(name) > 0) {\r\n    characters_data[i,] <- list(name, race_and_class[[1]][length(race_and_class[[1]]) - 1])\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow, we have the data in a dataframe. However, we are not done yet! As usual, the data is not in the right shape. Some of the observations has '?' as the character name, NA entries and trailing spaces. So, let's clean.\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# Remove rows with NA\r\ncharacters_data <- na.omit(characters_data)\r\n# Remove rows where name is '?'\r\ncharacters_data <- characters_data[grep('\\\\?', characters_data$name, invert = TRUE), ]\r\n# Remove \\n from the names\r\ncharacters_data$name <- sub('\\n', '', characters_data$name)\r\n# Remove the prefix '1st', '2nd', etc.\r\ncharacters_data$name <- sub('[0-9]?[0-9][a-z]{2}', '', characters_data$name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the previous piece of code, we removed rows that contains NA, character names '?', and the prefix '1st', '2nd', etc that was present on some of the names. If you take a look at the linked website, you will see why the data has this.\r\n\r\nWhile cleaning the data, I removed those characters whose respective races does not appear often in the dataset because they would probably do more harm than good at the time of predicting since we do not have a large number of characters from that race.\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# Subset the races that have a significant number of entries\r\ncharacters_data <- characters_data[characters_data$race == 'Ainur' | \r\n                        characters_data$race == 'Dwarf' |\r\n                        characters_data$race == 'Elf' |\r\n                        characters_data$race == 'Half-elf' |\r\n                        characters_data$race == 'Hobbit' |\r\n                        characters_data$race == 'Man', ]\r\n# Change the half-elves for elves (sorry Elrond)\r\ncharacters_data$race[characters_data$race == 'Half-elf'] <- 'Elf'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIMAGE\r\n\r\nSo we kept, the ainur, dwarves, men, hobbits, elves and half-elves. These last two groups were marge into one, called elf. The race with the weird characters is 'Dunedain'\r\n\r\nLastly, the trailing spaces were removed, as well to some characters who do not have an actual name, but a title, e.g. Master of Lake-town, and the surnames, e.g. Frodo Baggins -> Frodo and Thorin III -> Thorin.\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# Remove trailing spaces\r\ncharacters_data$name <- sub('[ \\t]+$', '', characters_data$name)\r\n# Remove an entry where the name is 'Others'\r\ncharacters_data <- characters_data[characters_data$name != 'Others' & \r\n                                     characters_data$name != 'Master of La...', ]\r\n\r\n# The names of the characters on this dataframe won't have any surnames or\r\n# numbers on their name; we'll keep just the first name.\r\ncharacters_no_surnames <- characters_data\r\n\r\n# Regex to remove everything after the first whitespace\r\ncharacters_no_surnames$name <- sub(' .*', '', characters_no_surnames$name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the data was exported to a text file. In addition to the dataset without surnames, I also included a second dataset with the full name of the character.\r\n\r\n```r\r\nwrite.csv(characters_no_surnames, file = 'characters_no_surnames.csv', row.names = FALSE)\r\nwrite.csv(characters_data, file = 'characters_data.csv', row.names = FALSE)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Model development and prediction\r\n***\r\n### Loading and pre-processing of data\r\nNow that we have the data, lets start the actual analysis in Spark. We will start by loading the data.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Import both the train and test dataset and register them as tables\r\nimported_data = sqlContext.read.format('com.databricks.spark.csv').options(\r\n    header='true') \\\r\n    .load('/Users/Juande/Development/lotr-names-classification/characters_no_surnames.csv')\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the data was exported from R as a CSV file, we need to load it as a CSV. Luckily for us, there is a package for Spark that handles this, [spark-csv](http://spark-packages.org/package/databricks/spark-csv).\r\n\r\nOnce the data is loaded, I created a new RDD made of four columns. These are:\r\n- **complete_name**: the name of the character, e.g. Aragorn\r\n- **name** : name of the character (in lower case) as a list of characters, e.g. ['a','r','a','g','o','r','n']\r\n- **race**: race of the character, as a number; 0.0 for man, 1.0 for ainur, 2.0 for elf, 3.0 for hobbit and 4.0 for dwarf.\r\n- **length**: number of characters in the name. This feature is not used for the prediction, but we'll see at the end of the report.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Map the race to a number\r\nrace_to_number = {'Man': 0.0, 'Ainur': 1.0, 'Elf': 2.0, 'Hobbit': 3.0, 'Dwarf': 4.0}\r\n\r\n# Build a new rdd made of a row that has the name of the character, the name as a list of the characters, the race of\r\n# the character and the length of the name (this might be used later)\r\ndata_rdd = imported_data.map(lambda row: Row(complete_name=row.name, name=list(row.name.lower()),\r\n                                             race=race_to_number[row.race], length=len(row.name)))\r\ndf = sqlContext.createDataFrame(data_rdd)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Transformation pipeline\r\n\r\nOne of the reason why I did this work, was to test Spark's ML pipeline. Normally, I used the MLLIB library for performing machine learning, but for this work I wanted to try ML and its pipeline for the first time. A pipeline is a sequence of stages where the data is transformed at each step. For more details of this, check the official documentation at [Spark's pipeline](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html#pipeline).\r\n\r\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  | Another |   Hobbit |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| ------- | -------- |\r\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |      w  |   Hi     |\r\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |       s |    Hola  |\r\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |        s| wdwdw    |","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
